# A letter from my weaker self!<a id="orgheadline1"></a>

I write this letter to myself to remember the time when I did things the wrong
way, whatever wrong means.

A couple of months ago I settled on late night running, or marathon, so to
speak, as a recreational nocturnal activity. It was really hard to run atop
those steep and stern hills. They never seemed to quaver. They stood their
ground firmly as with a purpose to stop my every next step. Descending a hill was
always somewhat relaxing, but the hills forced me down briskly and with an
intention severe enough to make me want to halt and walk.

I resorted to executing every step in my run with all my might. It always
worked. I knew when the left leg set the pace, when the right leg caught up,
and felt my body cooperate to make my run. It is  a truly refreshing
activity. However, I was doing it all wrong. I did not know, relatively speaking, how to run. To this effect, I was increasingly
suffering my knees. It became a routine to run on a certain day and limp, ever
so slightly, the next day. I endured it. My tolerance grew, but I was hurting myself.

Then I searched for running tips. I was awestruck. All these people having the
same knee and limping issues like me and searching for solutions. I tuned in to
some youtube channel, and watched a really nicely delivered video on how to
run and hurt yourself less. I diligently sucked in every lesson and dashed out
on the same  night to run like a good student. Well, no luck. I could not do as I was
instructed in the video. And I decided to give up running. Forever! And maybe
learn chess!

Later this evening, I read a chapter of *The Idiot* by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. I
laughed so hard and I became very joyous and wanted to do something I liked.
Sorting through my most liked activities and eager to engage in the top
item immediately I stumbled on running. Running was at the top of list. So I
set out to run with little or no idea that I had given up on such an activity
only a few days before. I got out, stretched a little and took off. First step,
second step, third step&#x2026; It felt good. And different!

I ran up the hill with a bit of struggle to catch my breath, but something
felt different. The way I took off after landing on the ground felt different
and encouraging. I repeated it again and again. First lap down and no knee
pain. Ok! I thought to myself. Maybe the lessons from the video are now in me
and are working. I then deliberately implemented the lessons ever so
carefully. I was satisfied and I had a spartan run, with a  bulldog determination
and no hurting knees. It was a beautiful experience. And during the run I had
the idea to write to myself about that experience and to document the lessons
learned.

Every now and an unaticipated then, I start a task, tussle through a fraction
of it  and finally give up. They say those who don&rsquo;t know their history are bound to repeat
it. Hence, doers who pay no attention to lessons from preceding doers are bound
to quit. Learning something as &ldquo;trivial&rdquo; as running taught me this; no, it
showed me this. What I remember most about the experience is the feeling of
satisfaction both in body and mind. I now feel like I can run for as long as I
desire. I am now fully equipped with the right techniques and they will likely
be improved.

Running the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way was gratifying and for some moments I felt like I was
repairing my body, my knees, my mind&#x2026;

If running the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way after running the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; way is this rejuvenating,
then I probably should never give up on any undertaking. When I feel like the
blows of weakness, poor technique, limited knowledge, I should probably take a
step back and look at my methods. Perhaps dig a little more into the history of
my undertaking. For learning the trick heals the mind and the body. The &ldquo;right&rdquo;
steps become medicine for the damages caused by the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; steps. I am in no
way ditching &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; steps. As much as I type these words, I don&rsquo;t know
what &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; really means.

Hence, self, &ldquo;Never give up&rdquo; and never forget to visit the history, including
this one.
