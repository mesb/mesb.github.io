# On Computer Science and Magic<a id="orgheadline5"></a>

Notes on computer science compiled as I read SICP.

Computer science is much like magic. Socerers command the spirits of the
ancestors to perform tasks. In computer science, we invoke the spirits
of the computer to perform computations. We do so in the guise of
computational processes.

## Process<a id="orgheadline1"></a>

&ldquo;A process is an abstract being that inhabits a computer and as it evolves it mutates
other abstract things called data.&rdquo; A process is much like a Socerers idea
of a spirit. It is abstract and magical but it does real things. Socerers
invoke spirits using spells. Spells in computer science and computer programming are called
procedures.

## Procedure<a id="orgheadline2"></a>

A procedure is a set of rules or more likely a pattern of local evolution of a process. It directs the
evolution of a computational process. A procedure is the spell used by a programmer or
computer scientist to command processes to do stuff. Socerers dispense
spells using esoteric languages. Their spells are communicated in ancient
Babylonian, Summerian or something. In computing, we need precise and well
formalized languages for communicating our ideas about processes in procedures. SICP uses
LISP for this purpose.

## Programming Languages: Lisp for SICP<a id="orgheadline3"></a>

A programming language is a tool for expressing our ideas about
computational processes. It is also a framework for taming the complexity of
the systems that evolve from the computational processes we compose. Much
like languages used by socerers, the language should come with some building
blocks from which our computational systems are constructed.

3 main building blocks every programming language should have are:

1.  Primitive Elements
    In the form of primitive data and procedures that come with the language. Most
    languages come with numbers, characters and primtive operators to combine
    and factor these elements.

2.  Means of Combination
    Means and glues for combining the primitive elements to build
    our own idealized components. Much like means of combinging spells to
    form bigger spells, family spells or combining lego blocks to build larger
    blocks. Modern languages have glues like classes, arrays, maps,
    functions, methods and files for combining elements.

3.  Means of Abstraction
    It becomes increasingly cumbersome to pass around huge structural blocks
    around a system. In natural languages, there exist single words that
    describe hectic and hairy processes. The word &ldquo;marathon&rdquo; for example
    informs a communicator at one end about the set of physicial activities
    and events encompassing running, resting, cheering etc. All of these are
    described by a single word.

    A programming language should have means by which programmers can name
    complex components and pass them around as single units in the same sense
    that simple words can be used to communicate complex
    information. Programming languages provide means for naming objects,
    classes, functions, files etc so that using these units can be as simple
    as passing around the names that identify them.
