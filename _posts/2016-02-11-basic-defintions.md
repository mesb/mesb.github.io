# Elementary Defintions<a id="orgheadline13"></a>

It's always a pleasure reading Euclid's Elements, Sir Isaac Newton's Principia
and Euler's works. I love the organization of their materials. It starts from
basic building blocks to empires. They define the elements of their systems in
very clear ways. I therefore, set up this page as an attempt to capture the
definitions of some of the building blocks of computer science, in the format
used by the sages before our time.

## Definitions<a id="orgheadline12"></a>

### Defintion I<a id="orgheadline2"></a>

A bit is that which has no part. It is either 1 or 0, and cannot be further
broken down into subunits.

### Definition II<a id="orgheadline3"></a>

A byte is a collection of 8 bits. A byte is a set of 8 bits that exist as a whole.

### Defintion III<a id="orgheadline4"></a>

A value is that which can be broken down into bits and bytes and makes sense
as a whole to the computing environment in which it belongs.

A value is a collection of bits or bytes that make sense only as a whole.

### Defition IV<a id="orgheadline5"></a>

A type is a set of values together with the permissible operations that can be
performed on the set.

### Defintion V<a id="orgheadline6"></a>

An object is that which has values and by virtue of its values belongs to
one or more types. Like an individual in a society, it has its identity and performs operations particular to
its types.

### Defintion VI<a id="orgheadline7"></a>

A prime object is that whose only parts are its native bits. It&rsquo;s only values
are the bits that form its bulk, and it can not be expressed as any other
object, but bits in a computing system.

### Defintion VII<a id="orgheadline8"></a>

A composite or compound object is that which is made of a collection of one or
more prime objects or other objects of its nature, that is other composite
objects, which could all be of thesame
type or different types, and together form a whole.

### Defintion VIII<a id="orgheadline9"></a>

Any object that forms part of a compound object is called a field or member.

### Definition IX<a id="orgheadline10"></a>

A homogenous composite object is that whose members are of the same type.

### Defintion X<a id="orgheadline11"></a>

A heterongeous composite object is that whose members are of different types.
