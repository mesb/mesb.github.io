I am very thankful to myelf, and the universe for giving me the opportunity to see
this day. While this might sound normal, it is very deep. Very deep in the
sense that, i see this day differently than i would have seen it under my
former convictions, and undertakings.

One month ago, i stumbled on an emacs<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> extension called Org-mode<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. Further
research on org-mode got me to discover a book titled /Getting Things Done/(GTD)<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> by David
Allen. What i love about it is the practically is puts you into. Just a throw
at the main idea I got from GTD.

*The mind is not meant for storing information, but for processing it.*

Therefore, we should generate and process ideas with the mind, but store these
information in a trusted location. I set out to implement this great way. It is
one of those capturing events that have gotten me into writing this post.

In this way, i can declutter my mind, by thinking, and storing developed
thoughts in text format. Eventually, i am left with more room and memory for
further capture and development of new ideas.

Once more, i'm so grateful :-)
