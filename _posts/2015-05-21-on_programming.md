I have traveled to the future to write this piece of work.

## What is Programming?<a id="orgheadline1"></a>

The art of composing computer programs.

## What is a computer program?<a id="orgheadline2"></a>

A set of rules governing a computational process, and is meant to be run by a
computer to achieve the required output(results), when given a suitable set of
input.

INPUT &#x2014;> PROGRAM &#x2014;> OUTPUT

Input goes in, and output comes out. Programs are deterministic.

## What is a computer program made of?<a id="orgheadline5"></a>

A computer program is made of 2 classes of objects:

### Function:<a id="orgheadline3"></a>

A function/procedure is a block of code or is a smaller program that is
contained within a program, that is deviced to perform a particular
sub-task or a particular subset of a computation. A function is also known
as a subroutine

A Function is like a paragraph in an essay. It is a cohesive subunit that
tackles a particular sub-task of an emergent program.

It's interesting to note that a program itself can be seen as a function or
subroutine in a larger system.

An example is the Microsoft Office Suite. Ms Excel is a spread sheet
program, but at higher levels, it can be seen as a function that permits
spreadsheet editing in the emergent Ms Office Suite.

### Data<a id="orgheadline4"></a>

Data are the values or valuable objects that are manipulated as the functions encircled in a
program are running. As functions or programs evolve, they mutate of
manipulate information called data. These pieces of information or data are
stored in registers or computer memory units known at higher levels as
variables.

## Program = Functions + Data<a id="orgheadline8"></a>

### A running program is a process, or a process is a program that is running.<a id="orgheadline6"></a>

### Truth<a id="orgheadline7"></a>

No matter what program we are looking at, it will be built from functions and data
objects. Terminology might vary, but the underlying concepts remain data and
functions/procedures.

## How are programs built?<a id="orgheadline9"></a>

Programs are built by composing functions, and data objects in containers called
variables.

In some programming environments, there is no difference between functions and
data objects, because both functions and data objects can be similarly
manipulated.

In a nutshell, programming is about composing a framework of coherent functions
and data structures that collectively and effectively solve a given
computational problem.

## Core programming practice<a id="orgheadline10"></a>

Composition through abstraction.

## What is abstraction<a id="orgheadline11"></a>

Abstraction is the process of composing or desingating a class of related
objects so as to secure a single umbrella unit that can be skillfully treated as
one, without bothering about any particular one, but efficiently tackling all
members of the unit.

## How is abstraction achieved<a id="orgheadline12"></a>

2 types of abstractions are observed in programming.

1.  Procedural abstraction
2.  Data abstraction

Both types of abstraction entail creating primitives and combining them to form
desired layers.

Procedural abstraction entails building composite procedures by combining
primtive procedures using:

-   conditionals
-   assignments
-   and closures

Data abstraction entails building composite data objects using:

-   assignments and closures

# So?<a id="orgheadline14"></a>

So programming is about functions and data.
