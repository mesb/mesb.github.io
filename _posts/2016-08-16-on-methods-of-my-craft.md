# On the methods of my craft

Programming has art, science and craftmanship in it. It is really hard to
capture exactly what it is about, for the various practitioners think about it
in assorted ways. In essence, the whole craft is like the huge elephant placed
before blind men who all perceive it differently. From my point of view, the
core of programming is about extension.

In trying to extend and augement our ability to perform the calculuations that emerge from
daily life, we slowly invented the computer. However, a computer system is a
set of components that work together to do what computers do. In the end, some
of these components tend to be extensions of others. We arrive at a somewhat
hierarchical system, but each layer serves as a simple extension of the
that which is below. How is that?

Let&rsquo;s begin with hardware. The computer hardware comes with the CPU, RAM, bus
systems, I/O devices etc,. but they are static. They can only do what they were
built to do. This set of all the innate functions that the computer hardware in
general and the computer's CPU in particular can do is called its instruction
set. At the point of manufacturing these hardware componnents, the creators know
little about all the possible uses of the equipment. It is impossible to
enumerate all the kinds of operations that will be performed on the
hardware. Needless to imagine the details of the operations. Will be hardware
be used to run snapChat, or build photoshop? These are all questions that
the manufacturers of computers can't answer or even predict.

However, the very basic nature of computing operations can be captured and
implemented in hardware. Some of such operations are:

1.  Load: load information from some location
2.  Store: save information to some location
3.  Add: perform addition on operands
4.  Jump: move to some particular operation or instruction

The short list above is very far away from the complete list of essential
hardware operations.

It gets interesting. If hardware is limited, how did we get to this point where
all sorts of amazing applications are built on computer systems?

The next extension to the hardware is the sytem software, often called the
operating system. However, there are many other system software that are not
necessarily operating systems. Since the language spoken by the CPU is limited,
a new extension is needed to interface between a wider universe of problems and
solutions and the limited universe of the CPU. The system software is crafted
to extend the hardware we started with. Like the hardware that the system
software is trying to extend, the system software itself is limited. System
software designers and builders do not know the details of all the applications
that will be run on computers via their software. But they need to get the system software
working, so they again do what was done at the layer of the hardware, although
at this point it becomes higher level.

At this level of extension, the most essential aspects of the system software
are captured, implemented and exposed to the users of system via an interface
called the &ldquo;system calls.&rdquo; In essence, the system calls are higher level
relative to the hardware, but are lowever level relative to the kinds of
problems and solutions in the upcoming universes of problems and
solutions. What then can be done to resolve this issue?

Like the old good solution of extending hardware, we need to extend the system
software. The components that are used to extend the system software are called
application programs. Application programs tend to be more dynamic than the
relatively static system software and the layers below it. However, it turns out that even application
software can be limited. At the point of inception and implememtation, the
programmers might not have an idea of the exact information that the
applications will be dealing with. They solve this problem in the old school
way we have described above; they extend the programs with data.

Application programs are often built for a set of permissible data called its
input. Most application programs also return results called output. In the same
way that application programs extend system software, data or input sets extend
static application programs. Such extensions neatly fit together and today we
can see how changed our world is. What is the next kind of extension we need?

Our world is made of an infinitude of problems and may be solutions. Resources
are scarce. We are constantly faced with the issue of targeting this infinitude
with a finite set of tools, ideas and solutions. By extending our relatively
finite systems, we achieve wider systems that can tackle the infinitde set of
probems we began with. Inherently, we try to capture the infite with the
finite.
