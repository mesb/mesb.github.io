    <h1>About this platform </h1>

      <p>There is just too much information out there to consume. Similarly, there is
        relatively too much information in me hustling to come out. I often write notes, make
        interesting summaries, but never get back to them. There is often some
        wonderful, warm air of understanding that surrounds me  when I read, most often when I
        read some piece of work for the n-th time where n > 2. This feeling eventually
        always gets me to document my understanding, but then I came to notice that
        I fail to re-read these notes, relive the moment that sparked the writing
        session, and above all limit my understanding by avoing to read these notes.</p>


      <p> Upon thinking about how to solve this problem, I was hit by the realization
        that maybe accessibility has a role to play. What if I made my notes available
        online, so that others can see and constructively criticize them? Having them
        online would also make it easy for me to navigate to them using electronic
        devices. These thoughts, and I am grateful for them, let me to assemble this
        web resource. The posts are just notes, observations, summaries, and text for
        my humble self and any person out there ready to read </p>

      <p>
        I would be most grateful to get feedback, either via email or any of the social
        media outlets mentioned here. Cheers! </p>
